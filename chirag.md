## **How Users Will Earn the 50M Coins**

### On-Chain Activity (High-Level Overview)
The distribution of WAX tokens will be determined by the following on-chain activities:

| Activity                                              | Percentage Weight |

### **User Wallet and Activity Scoring for Reward Distribution**
The **Civil Score** will be based on the following factors, which will determine the user's legitimacy and contribution to the platform:

- **Wallet Age & Activity**: How long the wallet has been active and the total number of transactions made.
- **Tokens Held**: The number and value of tokens held in the user's wallet.
- **NFTs Owned**: The quantity and rarity of NFTs held by the user.
  
### Transaction History Tiers (Based on Wallet Age)
The rewards will be distributed based on the number of days a user has been actively transacting, with tiers for different levels of engagement:

| Transaction Days                      | Reward Tier            |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **200 Days**                          | Tier 1                 |
| **500 Days**                          | Tier 2                 |
| **1000+ Days**                        | Tier 3                 |

The longer and more active a user is in the blockchain ecosystem, the higher their reward tier.
